# iOS Code Challenge

This test project is written in easily-extendable architecture (MVVM) with combine and Coordinators for routing. All Userinterfaces are build programatically for better reusability. I have used respository layer which decides either we need to fetch data from service layer or to get stored data.
I have seen coredata already included in this project so i assumed that i need to implement that but i also want to do it to show how we manage Repository layer using Single Resposibility principle
I use to try my best to follow SOLID in my code to develope loose coupled code which is easily extendable.
if i have more time i will improve code coverage and also shift this project to modular patteren by sepprating out networking, database and kit module.
I am not using any third party in this project and for UI i love to create it programatically and have written my own solution for that but did not include that in this assignment becasuse there is not much UI handling there.
Also Launch screen is created from plist. Its my first attempt to create it through plist.
